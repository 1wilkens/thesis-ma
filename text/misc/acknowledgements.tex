I would first like to thank Prof. Mathias Fischer for giving me the chance the tackle this interesting challenge. Reverse engineering has always me a dream of mine and I really enjoyed the time spent deciphering Dridex's architecture and protocols.

\bigskip

Additionally, I thank my thesis advisor Steffen Haas for providing invaluable feedback especially in the last days of writing. The discussions with you significantly influenced the shape and content of this thesis.

\bigskip

I am also very grateful to David Jost for his tireless tech support in Python, Latex or Tikz questions. Without you the figures would not be half as pretty.

\bigskip
\bigskip

Finally, I must express my gratitude to my parents and to my girlfriend for providing me with support and continuous encouragement through the process of researching and writing this thesis. This accomplishment would not have been possible without them.
\smallskip

Thank you!
